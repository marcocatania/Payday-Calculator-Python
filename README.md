# Payday-Calculator-Python


This program computes the net salary UK (Scotland not supported) on a gross income.
I wrote an adapted version on Objective-C for an iOS app, published on the App Store for free: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/net-salary-calculator-uk/id1336197460?mt=8


The program gives details about the taxes paid and the take-home salary.
