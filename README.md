# Payday-Calculator-Python


This program computes the net salary (England) on a gross income not exceeding the first tax rate revenue for NI and IR (because the code has been written to help colleagues with basic income - so higher incomes are not included and will get a wrong result).

I wrote an adapted version for Objective-C for an iOS app, published on the App Store for free: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/net-salary-calculator-uk/id1336197460?mt=8

The program gives details about the taxes paid and the take-home salary.
